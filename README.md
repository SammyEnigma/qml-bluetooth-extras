qml-bluetoothextras
===================

QML wrappers for missing Qt Bluetooth objects. More Qt Bluetooth wrappers might come soon. It is tested with Qt 5.6.2 on
the following:

  - Ubuntu 16.04
  - Android 6.0.1 (arm-v7) built with SDK API 19 and NDK r10e on Ubuntu 16.04 host

build
-----

```
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ qmake ..
    $ make install
```

This will install the QML plugin inside the Qt sysroot. **Be aware that this is not a sandboxed installation.**
